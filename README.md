# Smart AI Platform for Future Manufacturing
> 🧠 Built at [Hackathon Name], 2025 – by Xarch Labs

XFactory is an intelligent AI-powered platform designed to transform modern manufacturing by enabling small to medium-sized factories to monitor, analyze, and improve operations with cutting-edge automation and actionable insights — all in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional manufacturing setups, especially in emerging regions, often lack efficient visibility into quality, waste, and machine performance. This leads to:
- High scrap rates
- Increased cost of poor quality (COPQ)
- Undetected machine faults
- Delays in defect identification
- Wastage of raw materials & energy

---

## ✅ Our Solution

XFactory provides:
- 🌐 A **real-time centralized dashboard** for factory analytics
- 📉 **AI models** that predict & prevent production losses
- 👁️ **Computer Vision** that detects defects automatically
- 🔧 **Live machine health tracking**
- ♻️ **Waste optimization insights** using smart algorithms

All of this is presented in an accessible, scalable platform even small manufacturers can operate with ease — from mobile or desktop.

---

## 🔐 Core Functional Pillars (Abstract)

1. **Machine Health Monitoring** – Live data stream to detect anomalies early.
2. **Product Standards QA** – Automated quality checks & standards compliance.
3. **Defect Detection** – Computer Vision pipeline for surface-level defects.
4. **Waste Management** – AI-generated reports for raw material efficiency.
5. **Factory Intelligence Dashboard** – First Pass Yield, COPQ, Warranty Claims, Supplier Scores & more.
